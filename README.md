# Handstel Backend Api for the Community App

This is a [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) application which served as the backend for the community version of the handstel app in 2014. The data layer is written using PDO. The application uses a token based authentication.

Some of the important features supported by the app were:
+ Join/Leave Group
+ Peer to Peer/Group Messaging using [Pubnub](https://www.pubnub.com/)
+ Push Notification
+ Add/Edit Profile
